Welcome to Thermal 2D rot-sym's documentation!
==============================================
This is a thermal model for rotational symetrical simulation domains.
The domains are going to be build up from blocs.
As regalr mesh is used.
Each blocks position and dimension is measured in discrete coordinates which represent the grid nodes.
